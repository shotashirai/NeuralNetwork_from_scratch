# Neural Network from scratch
Neural networks from scratch using python and C++ without using existing machine learning libraries. (Python uses Numpy library for calculations)

## Network structure
The network has three hidden layers. The signal propagates forward. Sigmoid function (hidden layers) and softmax function (output layer) are used as activation functions. In this project, the trained weight was used to initialize the network.

## Implement image recognition task
MNIST dataset was used for handwritten digit recognition tasks. The networks classified 10,000 test images with an accuracy of 93.5%. Compared to Python, C++ achieved 10 times faster processing time.
